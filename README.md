# ✈️ Travel-Buddy

Travel Buddy aims to ease the stress of planning a trip. Everyone loves to travel but rarely does anyone like to plan. With Travel Buddy, users can simply input a desired destination and receive suggestions from Travel Buddy. Users can customize and finalize plans within the system by manually setting flight dates and times, hotel information, and fun excursions into our system. Are users completely lost with where to start? Our ChatGPT API integration can list out an entire suggested trip to their destination, within their budget. Travel Buddy displays all this information out in a dashboard to give users a clear overview of their ideal trip.
