# ‚úàÔ∏è Travel Buddy

Travel Buddy aims to ease the stress of planning a trip. Everyone loves to travel but rarely does anyone like to plan. With Travel Buddy, users can simply input a desired destination and receive suggestions from Travel Buddy. Users can customize and finalize plans within the system by manually setting flight dates and times, hotel information, and fun excursions into our system. Are users completely lost with where to start? Our LLaMA integration can list out an entire suggested trip to their destination, within their budget. Travel Buddy displays all this information out in a dashboard to give users a clear overview of their ideal trip.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

Traveling is an exciting and memorable experience, but for people who want to be well-prepared for trips, planning the details can be a hassle. From booking flights to researching activities and food options while staying on budget, the planning process can be discouraging. That‚Äôs why Travel Buddy was developed to simplify and organize travel planning, making the process more enjoyable, personalized, and most importantly, stress-free.

Travel Buddy offers a variety of features designed to allow users to customize and finalize their plans to organize all essential trip details. Features of Travel Buddy include:

1. **Comprehensive Dashboard**: This hub presents all the necessary trip information in a user-friendly way. This dashboard gives an organized view of the itinerary, flight information, booking confirmations, and any activities on the schedule. With this feature, every aspect of the trip is contained in one central place for easy access.
2. **Customizable Trip Planning**: Users can manually input key details such as flight dates and flight number, hotel reservation, and activities. This feature allows user to have full control over their itinerary and fine-tune their trip plans to their personal preferences.
3. **AI-Generated Itinerary**: By integrating with the LLaMA, users can automatically generate a complete trip itinerary if they don‚Äôt know where to start. Based on the user‚Äôs destination and budget, this AI-driven feature will recommend a full itinerary and suggest activities for users who are not sure where to begin.

Our app aims for a wide range of users who are seeking a simpler way to plan their trips. Our primary audience includes:

With a combination of customization and AI-assistance, our app provides the tools for traveling users to plan their trips effortlessly and efficiently.
